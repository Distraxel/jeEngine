Welcome to the JelloEngine official documentation.  
/GRAPHICS/ has all of you graphical needs.  
/EVENTS/ is all things eventful(e.g. keyboard/mouse input).  
/MASKS/ contains a few classes for collision.  
And everything else is other stuff.  
For Entity management, I reccomend Entities.md, Group.md, and World.md.
